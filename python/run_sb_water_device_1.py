Sparkplug B Water Level Simulator Runner

This script serves as the entry point for running the Sparkplug B water level simulator
with pre-configured settings for the sb_water_device_1 device. It initializes the simulator
with database-derived configuration parameters and manages the simulation lifecycle.

The script provides a simplified interface for users to start the Sparkplug B compliant
water level monitoring simulation without manually configuring device parameters.

Key Features:
    - Pre-configured device settings from iot_device database table
    - Automatic simulator initialization and lifecycle management
    - Graceful error handling and user-friendly output
    - Configurable simulation duration with keyboard interrupt support

Usage:
    python run_sb_water_device_1.py

Requirements:
    - paho-mqtt library: pip install paho-mqtt
    - tahu library: pip install tahu
    - Running EMQX broker on localhost:1883 (or update broker_host in config)

    Main entry point for the sb_water_device_1 Sparkplug B simulator runner.

    This function initializes and runs the Sparkplug B water level simulator with
    pre-configured settings for the sb_water_device_1 device. It handles the complete
    simulation lifecycle from configuration setup through execution and graceful shutdown.

    The function performs the following operations:
    1. Displays startup information and device configuration
    2. Initializes the SparkplugBWaterLevelSimulator with device-specific parameters
    3. Starts the simulation with a predefined duration
    4. Handles user interrupts and error conditions gracefully

    Configuration Details:
        - Device ID: Unique identifier from iot_device table
        - Client ID: MQTT client identifier for broker connection
        - Authentication: Username/password for EMQX broker access
        - Network: Broker host and port configuration
        - Protocol: Community and edge node identifiers for Sparkplug B

    Returns:
        int: Exit code (0 for success, 1 for error)

    Raises:
        KeyboardInterrupt: Handled gracefully to allow user-initiated shutdown
        Exception: Caught and logged with user-friendly error message

    Note:
        The simulation duration is set to 10 minutes by default. Modify the
        duration_minutes parameter to change this behavior, or set to None
        for continuous operation.
